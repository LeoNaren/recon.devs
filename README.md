Our uses Google Maps API to gain real-time data.
We have introduced and are still introducing factors that are considered to mark a place as safe for women.
These factors include:
  Proximity of emergency places such as police stations or healthcare facilities
  The employment ratio of the area
  Areas history, etc.
